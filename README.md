# quarantinepole

The motivation behind this project is to crowdsource information on virtual pole, dance, and fitness related classes being offered by instructors and studios across the nation. The data is stored on the Google Spreadsheet and accessed via JavaScript. The webpage interface is built with BootStrap, JavaScript, CSS/HTML. By default, the remaining available classes for the current day is displayed. The user can search for classes by date, type of class (pole, dance, stretching, yoga, etc.), or instructor name.
